Web Shared Bookmarks for PHP

The icon is by [Forrest Walter](http://www.forrestwalter.com/).

I recommend using [Awardspace](https://awardspace.net) for free hosting with dynamic content (PHP) and [Freenom](https://freenom.com) for a free domain name with cloaking.

**Authenticate your IP for append permissions** : `/?authme`

**Un-Authenticate ALL IP's _(logout)_** : `/?kill`

**Submit a new url** : `/?https://google.com/q=this search` || `/?q=https://google.com/q=this search` || `/?a=<website url>`

This method allows you to create essentially completely anonymouse free URL index sites for [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/) or any other purpose. You can also use this simple system to transmit messages such as `/?q=Hey Bob/How is the weather in California?`

You might want to change the `authme` keyword to something unique unless you want randoms to be able to append to your links list.
